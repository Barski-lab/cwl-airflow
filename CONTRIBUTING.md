## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
4. Ensure the test suite passes
6. Issue that pull request
